					<h2>About me</h2>
					<hr>

							<p>Approved at the age of 14 in the competition of Colégio Naval of Marinha do Brasil, completing my military high school in 2019 at the age of 18. After that, I started college at Escola Naval, the first higher education institution in the country, where I studied for 2 years and 3 months. I left the military career with the aim of following the path of programming   </p>

							<p>I think it is important to point out that in this period of 5 years as a soldier, in addition to being a student, he also carried out activities intrinsic to the military, in which decision-making was stimulated; leadership; personnel administration; organization; hierarchy and discipline; and the spirit of the body. In my last year at Colégio Naval I took over positions such as: Commander of the oceanic sailboat Cação, where I coordinated and led 5 other soldiers in the preparation, maintenance and navigation in several regattas and crossings; That of deputy commodore of the sailing team where I helped the officers in the leadership and administration of it; And that of CIA secretary, in which I helped in the administration of the OM (military organization).</p>

							<p>In the Naval School, everyone from the first year has already carried out various administration activities, ranging from bidding and internal documents, to organizing events. besides of course a very strong study base. worth mentioning the subjects that I concluded: calculus 1,2,3 and 4; physics 1,2,3 and 4; numerical calculation 1 and 2; mechanics 1 and 2; electronics 1 and 2; fundamentals of information technology 1 and 2; and statistics 1 and 2.</p>
							<p>I am currently taking a degree in software engineering at INFNET, and other courses out there, I am in the middle of a Java course at Alura and I recently completed an HTML/CSS course by Professor Ivan Lourenço Gomes through the Udemy platform , in which I learned the direct application of knowledge in building an elegant and responsive online portfolio / Website.</p>
